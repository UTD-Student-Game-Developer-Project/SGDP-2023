## About

The 2023 project is still in the pitch phase. Once a pitch has been chosen, we will update this section with more information.

## Getting Started

These guidelines will help you get started with the project. However, they can be followed loosely if you know what you're doing. If you have any questions, please contact us on Discord.

### Prerequisites

- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/) with [Unity 2021.3.3f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) installed
- [GitKraken Client](https://www.gitkraken.com/) or another Git client

### Creating Your Environment

You will need Unity 2021.3.3f1 to work on the project. You can download it [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive). We recommend using Unity Hub to manage your Unity installations.

Once you have Unity installed, you can clone the repository. You can do this by opening GitKraken and clicking the "Clone a repo" button or clicking "File" > "Clone" > "Clone with URL". Then, enter the URL of the repository and select a location to clone it to. You can find the URL of the repository by clicking the "Code" button on the GitHub page.

Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the project in Unity. You can do this by opening Unity Hub and clicking the "Open" button. Then, select the folder where you cloned the repository. You can now open the project by selecting it.

### Contributing

To start, create a branch in GitKraken by clicking the "Branch" button. Then, enter a name for your branch and click "Create Branch". You can now make changes to the project. Once you are done, you can commit your changes by clicking the "Commit" button. Then, enter a message for your commit and click "Commit to Branch". You can now push your changes to the repository by clicking the "Push" button.

Once you have pushed your changes, you can create a pull request on GitHub. Open GitHub and navigate to the repository. Then, click the "Pull requests" button and click "New pull request". Then, select your branch as the "compare" branch and the "main" branch as the "base" branch. You can now create your pull request by clicking "Create pull request".

Fill out the pull request template and click "Create pull request". You can now wait for your pull request to be reviewed by a lead and merged.

### Merge Conflicts

If you run into merge conflicts and you cannot figure out how to resolve them yourself, contact a lead on Discord. They will help you resolve the merge conflicts.
